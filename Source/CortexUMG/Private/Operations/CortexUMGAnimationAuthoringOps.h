 * Native guarded authoring for UMG widget animations (issue176).

 * umg.set_animation_property_track — creates/replaces/clears exactly one float or linear-color
 *   native property track on an existing ordinary binding.
 *
 * Both commands validate the full request and expected fingerprint before any Modify, run inside a
 * single transaction with a GC-safe journal, verify the live result and (on failure) restore and
 * verify restoration before cancelling. Unproven restoration blocks later writes through the shared
 * asset mutation guard. Neither command compiles, saves or repairs anything implicitly.
